This project implements a Microsoft-style fake login window using Browser-in-the-Browser (BITB) for research, education, and security awareness testing.
It accurately simulates a Microsoft authentication popup inside the browser, replicating the look, size, and behavior of the real window.

In addition, the project includes Discord Webhook integration, allowing captured test data to be automatically sent to a private monitoring channel.

🚀 Features

Realistic BITB interface identical to Microsoft’s login popup

Fully responsive window with simulated titlebar and borders

Captures entered username and password for testing purposes

Automatic data delivery to a Discord Webhook
